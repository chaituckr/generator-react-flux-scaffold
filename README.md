> Scaffolding for project with react, fulx and glup.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-flux-scaffold using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

npm install -g generator-react-flux-scaffold
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo react-flux-scaffold
```

Then start your project:

```bash
gulp
```

## Folder Structure

  * This generator gives you a folder structure as below:
              
            -- docs                               (To store the application docs if any)
            -- src                                (Main Application Folder)
                -- actions                        (All the action files)
                -- components                     (All React Components)
                    -- HomeComponent              (Folder for each component)
                        -- home.css               (Css file for Home component)
                        -- Home.js                (Component file)
                        -- package.json           (this will have version of Component, this is different from Project package.json)
                -- constants                      (all constants for our application)
                -- dispatcher                     (Flux dispather that dispatches our actions)
                -- images                         (images req for our app)
                -- routes                         (This will have routes to our components, we are using "react-router")
                -- services                       (Here we can do ajax/service calls)
                -- stores                         (Flux stores for our app)
                -- utils                          (Anything else like properties files)
                -- index.html                     (Only HTML page for our app)
                -- main.js                        (starting point of our app)
            -- .bablerc
            -- .gitignore
            -- gulpfile.js
            -- package.json
